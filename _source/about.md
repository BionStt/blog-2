Why ASP.NET Hacker? It doesn't really have a deeper sense. I chose this name because we got some blue ASP.NET Hacker badges on the ASP.NET hackathon at the MVP Summit 2015 in Redmond.

 I think this matches exactly what we do with ASP.NET, if we want do achieve the customers requirements. And this matches more exactly what we did in the past with ASP.NET Webforms. We hacked around ASP.NET to get the things working. Finally it is the recommended way to hack around ASP.NET Core. To extend, to reduce, to transform ASP.NET Core and .NET Core Applications to solve problems and to get the customers happy. ;)

I am a .NET addicted web developer, working with ASP.NET since 2002. (I started playing around in 2001 with the beta versions of .NET 1.0)

Since July 2015 I am awarded as a [Microsoft MVP for Visual Studio and Development Technologies (former ASP.NET/IIS)](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/PublicProfile/5001508?fullName=J%C3%BCrgen%20Gutsch)

Along with family and job, I'm writing articles in .NET Magazines and posts in this blog about ASP.NET, .NET, web technologies and the .NET community. I'm also leading a [.NET user group in Basel](http://www.dotnet-nordwest.ch/). From January 2007 until November 2015 I was also leading the .NET user group Konstanz-Kreuzlingen

## Become a blog sponsor

Currently I'm looking for a sponsor that supports me writing good and valuable content. Currently I’m using Google AdWords to get some money out of the effort I push into my blog. Actually I’d like to remove Google AdWords to provide more valuable and more relevant advertisement to the readers. I don't want to annoy readers with AdWords banners and unrelated content.
