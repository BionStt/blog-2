The people who know me, also know that I'm a huge fan of consoles and CLIs. I run the dotnet CLI as well as the Angular CLI and the create-react CLI. Yeoman is also a tool I like. I own a Mac, but cannot really work with the Mac UI. I really prefer the terminal in Mac. Also Git is used in the console the most time. The only situation where I don't use git in the console, is while resolving merge conflicts. I configured KDiff3 as the merge tool. I don't really need a graphic user interface for all the other tasks to work with Git. 

So I do using the Git Flow process. 

## About Git Flow

In general Git Flow is a branching concept over Git. It is pretty clear and intuitive, but following this concept manually in Git is a bit hard and needs some time. Git Flow is now implemented in many graphical user interfaces like SourceTree. This reduces the overhead.

Git flow is mainly about merging and branching. It defines two main branches, which are "master" as the production/release branch and "develop" as the working branch. The actual work is done in different types of feature branches:

* "feature" a branch created based on "develop" to implement new featues
  * will be merged back to "develop"
  * branch name pattern: feature/<name|ticket|#123-my-feature>
* "release" a branch created based on "develop" to create a new release
  * the branch name gets the tag name
  * will create a tag
  * will be merged to "master" and "develop"
  * branch name pattern: release/<tag|version|1.2.0>
* "hotfix" a branch created based on "master"
  * the branch name gets the tag name
  * will create a tag
  * will merge to "master" and "develop"
  * branch name pattern: hotfix/<tag|version|1.2.3>
* "bugfix" less popular. We use "feature" to create bug fixes
  * not available in all tools
  * behaves like "feature"
* "support" much less popular. We don't use it
  * not available in all tools
  * almost behaves like hotfixes

I propose to have a look into the Git Flow Cheat Sheet documentation to see how the branching concept works: http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/

Git Flow is also a tool provided as Git extension. This reduces branching, merging, releasing tagging to just one single command and does all the needed tasks in the background for you. This CLI makes it super easy to follow Git Flow.

## Install Git Flow as Git Extension

The installation is a bit annoying, because it needs a some additional tools and some more tasks for just a small Git extension.

To install it you need cygwin, which also is a console that gives you Linux like tools on Windows. The easiest way to install cygwin is to use Chocolatey, which is a packat manager for Windows. (apt-get for windows). You can also install it manually by running the installer, but you need to ensure to also install cyg-get, wget and util-linux, which is much easier using Chocolatey.

To install Chocolatey follow the instructions on https://chocolatey.org

Open a console and type the following commands

~~~ shell
choco install cygwin
choco install cyg-get
~~~

If this is done you can use cyg-get to install the needed extensions for the cygwin console

Open the console and type the following commands:

~~~ shell
cyg-get isntall wget
cyg-get isntall util-linux
~~~

Now the cygwin is ready to use to install Git Flow. Type

~~~ shell
cygwin
~~~

This will open the cygwin bash inside the current console.  

Now you are able to run the installation of Git Flow. Copy the following command to the cygwin bash and press enter:

~~~ bash
wget -q -O - --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow-avh/develop/contrib/gitflow-installer.sh install stable | bash
~~~

If this is done exit the bash by typing `exit` and close the console by typing `exit`. Closing the consoles and open it again ensures all the environment variables needed are available. 

Open a new console and type `git flow`. You should now see the Git Flow CLI help like this:

Every time you checkout or create a new repository you need to run `git flow init` to enable Git Flow. Using this command you will setup Git Flow on an existing repository by configuring the different branch prefixes and specifying the two main branches. I would propose to choose the default prefixes and names.
