If you have a Middleware that needs to work on a specific path, you should implement it by mapping it to a route, instead of checking the path names. This post doesn't handle regular Middlewares, which need to work all request, or all requests inside a `Map` or `MapWhen` branch.

At the Global MVP Summit 2019 in Redmond  I attended the hackathon where I worked on the GraphQL Middlewares for ASP.NET Core. I asked Glen Condron for a review of the API and the way the Middleware gets configured. He told me that we did it all right. We followed the proposed way. But he also told me that there is a new way in ASP.NET Core 3.0 to use this kind of Middlewares. 

Glen asked James Newton King who works on the new routing to show me how this need to be done in ASP.NET Core 3.0. James pointed me to the ASP.NET Core Health Checks and explained me the new way.

> BTW: That's closing the loop: Four summits ago Damien Bowden and I where working on the initial drafts of the ASP.NET Core Health Checks together with Glen Condron ;-)

The new ASP.NET Core 3.0 implementation of the GraphQL Middlewares is on the aspnetcore30 branch of the repository: [https://github.com/JuergenGutsch/graphql-aspnetcore](https://github.com/JuergenGutsch/graphql-aspnetcore)

## How it worked before

Until now you used MapWhen to map the middleware to a specific condition defined in a predicate:

~~~ csharp
Func<HttpContext, bool> predicate = context =>
{
    return context.Request.Path.StartsWithSegments(path, out var remaining) &&
                            string.IsNullOrEmpty(remaining);
};

return builder.MapWhen(predicate, b => b.UseMiddleware<GraphQlMiddleware>(schemaProvider, options));
~~~

([ApplicationBuilderExtensions.cs](https://github.com/JuergenGutsch/graphql-aspnetcore/blob/feature/aspnetcore30/GraphQl.AspNetCore/ApplicationBuilderExtensions.cs))

In this case the path is checked. This is pretty common to not only map based on paths. This allows you to map also on all other kind of criteria based on the HttpContext.

Also Map was a way to go:

~~~ csharp
builder.Map(path, branch => branch.UseMiddleware<GraphQlMiddleware>(schemaProvider, options));
~~~

## How this should be done now

In ASP.NET Core 3.0 these kind of mappings should be done using the `EndpoiontRouteBuilder`. If you create a new ASP.NET Core 3.0 web application. MVC is added a little different in the `Startup.cs` than before:

~~~ csharp
app.UseRouting(routes =>
{
    routes.MapControllerRoute(
        name: "default",
        template: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    routes.MapRazorPages();
});
~~~

The method `MapControllerRoute()` adds the controller based MVC and Web API. The new ASP.NET Core Health Checks, which also provide an own endpoint will also be added like this. Means we now have `Map` methods as extension methods on the `IEndpointRouteBuilder` instead of `Use` methods on the `IApplicationBuilder`. It is still possible to use the `Use` methods.

In case of the GraphQL Middleware it looks like this:

~~~ csharp
var pipeline = routes.CreateApplicationBuilder()
    .UseMiddleware<GraphQlMiddleware>(schemaProvider, options)
    .Build();

return routes.Map(pattern, pipeline)
    .WithDisplayName(_defaultDisplayName);
~~~

([EndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.cs](https://github.com/JuergenGutsch/graphql-aspnetcore/blob/feature/aspnetcore30/GraphQl.AspNetCore/EndpointRouteBuilderExtensions.cs))

Based on the current `IEndpointRouteBuilder` a new `IApplicationBuilder` is created, where we Use the GraphQL Middleware as before. We pass the `ISchemaProvider` and the `GraphQlMiddlewareOptions` as arguments to the Middleware. The result is a `RequestDelegate` in the `pipeline` variable.

The configured endpoint `pattern` and the `pipeline` than gets mapped to the `IEndpointRouteBuilder`. The small extension Method `WithDisplayName()` sets the configured display name to the endpoint. 

> I needed to copy this extension method to my code base, because the current development build of ASP.NET Core didn't contain this method two weeks ago. Need to check the latest version ASAP.

In ASP.NET Core 3.0 the GraphQl and the GraphiQl Middleware can now added like this:

~~~ csharp
app.UseRouting(routes =>
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        routes.MapGraphiQl("/graphiql");
    }
    
    routes.MapGraphQl("/graphql");
    
    routes.MapControllerRoute(
        name: "default",
        template: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
    routes.MapRazorPages();
});
~~~

## Conclusion

The new ASP.NET Core 3.0 implementation of the GraphQL Middlewares is on the aspnetcore30 branch of the repository: [https://github.com/JuergenGutsch/graphql-aspnetcore](https://github.com/JuergenGutsch/graphql-aspnetcore)

This approach feels a bit different. In my opinion it messes the `startup.cs` a little bit. Previously we added one middleware after another... line by line to the `Configure()` method. With this approach we have some Middlewares still registered on the `IApplicationBuilder` and some others on the `IEndpointRouteBuilder` inside a lambda expression. 

The other thing is, that the order isn't really clear anymore. When will the Middlewares inside the UseRouting be executed?

There is still some tome to do some rethinking about that. But maybe this will be the way to go with ASP.NET Core
